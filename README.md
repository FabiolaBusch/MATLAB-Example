# MATLAB-Example


 This is the type of scripts I work with. In this example, I implemented an
 analysis to identify an analyze specific epoch transitions. 
 
 Some function and variable names have been modified to the original
 script. The additionally used functions for data processing and mean cal-
 culation were made by colleagues.
